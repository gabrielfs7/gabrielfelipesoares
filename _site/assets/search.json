They are the CoSICi principles. I have invented this word to help me out memorize them! So far it is working and I would like to share it!\n\n\n\n1. (Co) Coupling &amp; Cohesion\n\nBesides the different names, Coupling and Cohesion are intimally related, cause \nboth concern about software complexity.\n\nBefore explain each one, lets first define what is considered a module within this scope.\n\nModule can be a:\n\n\n  Software Component.\n  A Class\n  A Method of a Class\n  A Function\n\n\nCoupling\n\nCoupling represents the level of complexity involving multiple modules.\n\nCohesion\n\nCohesion represents the level of complexity inside a single module.\n\nAnd how to evaluate complexity?\n\nTo evaluate complexity we consider 3 important aspects: Degree, Easy, Flexibility:\n\nDegree\n\nThe Degree relates to the number of connections between modules. Are they tighlty coupled\nto other modules?\n\nEasy\n\nThe Easy relates to how obvious are these connections. Do they follow a standard with meaningfull names and purspose?\n\nFlexibility\n\nCan the module be used by others without refactoring? Does it have a generic interface that can be easily used by other modules without colateral effect?\n\n2. (S) Separation of Concerns\n\nA component, service, class or method should have a single, clear and meaningfull purpose.\n\nHere comes handy the usage of SOLID principles, specially the (S) Single Responsibility.\n\nTips:\n\n\n  Relay on interfaces instead of concrete classes. When creating inerfaces, you can better define the classes responsibility.\n  Use propeties and methods access modifiers to restrict access.\n  Expose only necessary information on the APIs.\n  Avoid to appropriate data from other Domains to your application. Respect the Softwares Boundaries\n\n\n3. (I) Information Hiding\n\nA module should only expose necessary information for other components. This means that a module\nshould only know what he needs to know to fill his purpose and also only expose information that is necessary for other modules purposes.\n\nBe aware to use encapsulation and guard methods (i.e setter / constructors / getters) to receive and expose information in the correct ways.\n\n4. (CI) Conceptual Integrity\n\nI like to say the Conceptual Integrity is as good as the the alignment of business knowlege, technical expertise and process compliance that the individuals have.\n\nTips:\n\n\n  Follow a code standard.\n  Traininig and adjust knowledge levels of the individuals to be as similar as possible.\n  Do Code Reviews to reinforce the standards are being applyed.\n  Have a weel defined, accepted and execute SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). Does not matter if you use Scrum, Kanban, whaterfall or whatever. If it is accepted and used by the individuals, this is what matters.\n\n\n",
