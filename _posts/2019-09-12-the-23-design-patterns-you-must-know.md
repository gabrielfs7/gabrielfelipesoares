If you do not know the book I am talking about, it is [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612).
Even nowadays the Book is still handy and we realize how timeless is its content.

# Before we start

So what are **Design Patterns**? 

Yes, Design Patterns are everywhere we need to do a recurring action.

Besides construction, medicine, engineering, we have patterns also for teaching people, cooking (recipes), social interactions (greet, thanks, apologize), selling, designing packings and many many others areas.

Basically, for any repeating task, by experience, the specialists found approaches that work better on each situation and then it becomes a pattern.

Along the history developers have solved similar problems with different solutions. It turned out that to solve common problems, some solutions provided a better result and made the code more **ReFlexMain**, which is **Reusable, Flexible and Maintainable**, the holy trinity.

As an Architect, Software Engineer or Developer, Design patterns will give to you the **Foundation** to solve more complex design problems.
